# FAKE NEWS

Fake news consists of information has no authenticity. This kind if information can be propagated by misunderstanding or masterfully fabricated to gain advantages. These are manipulated to look like credible journalistic reports that can be easily spread across on online platform to reach large audiences willing to believe the fictions and spread the word.

As technology is advancing people are getting connected more and more socially. The spread of a news in an individual's circle and beyond is matter of seconds. By pressing one share button, and can initiate a thread that can reach many. Although, such negative outcomes were not called for when these technologies came into existense. 

# Impacts

Fake news can have major impacts in shaping world view as we make important decisions based on information. We form opinions regarding many things based on information, if this source is wrong and information is invented, false, exaggerated or distorted, our opinions, decisions are likely to be wrong. To name a few examples:
1. Fear
2. Racist ideas
3. Bullying and violence against innocent people
4. Democratic impacts

# Dataset

I have used the two fake news dataset from kaggle to train and test the model. In this dataset, we have title and its output, depicting whether the title is fake or not.
This dataset contains news from 2017 and 2018.

# Project

In this project, we have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using sci-kit libraries from python. 
This model takes news headline and provides outcome predicting whether the news is fake or not.

Refer the python notebook (fake-news-classifier-LSTM.ipynb) to go through the code.

In my project, I have used NLP techniques and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithm to preprocess the entry and predict whether news is fake or not. LSTM have proved to be very useful in dealing with such classification as they store previous information to predict outcomes. 

# Software and Libraries

For this project, I have used the following software and Python libraries:
1. python version >= python 2.7
2. numPy
3. pandas
4. tensorflow
5. keras
6. scikit-learn
7. Jupyter Notebook
